Define a function called `data_type`, to take one argument. Compare and return results, based on the argument supplied to the function. Complete the test to produce the perfect function that accounts for all expectations.

1. For `strings`, return its length.
2. For `None` return `string 'no value'`
3. For `booleans` return `the boolean`
4. For `integers` return a string showing how it compares to hundred e.g. For `67` return `'less than 100'` for `4034` return `'more than 100'` or `equal to 100` as the case may be
5. For `lists` return the 3rd item, or `None` if it doesn't exist
